   <h2>Description</h2>
   <p>Mandazi (Swahili: mandazi, maandazi) is a form of fried bread that originated on the Swahili coast. It is also known as bofrot or puff-puff in Western African countries such as Ghana and Nigeria. It is one of the principal dishes in the cuisine of the Swahili people who inhabit the coastal region of Kenya and Tanzania.</p>
  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>All purpose flour</li>
    <li>Instant yeast</li>
    <li>Sugar</li>
    <li>Baking Powder</li>
    <li>Ground cardamon</li>
    <li>Salt</li>
    <li>Luke warm milk</li>
    <li>Melted butter/margarine</li>
    <li>1 whole egg</li>
      </ul>  
      <h2>Instructions</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Mix the dry ingredients in a bowl and set aside</li>
        <li>Add the wet ingredients into a separate bowl and mix well</li>
        <li>Now add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients and knead into a dough.</li>
        <li>Cover with a damp cloth and set aside to rise for 1 hour or until the dough has doubled in size.</li>
        <li>Roll out the dough (1cm in height) on a lightly floured surface. Cut out triangular shapes.</li>
        <li>In a thick bottomed pan, add enough oil to deep fry. The oil is ready to use when you put a wooden skewer in it and bubbles form around the skewer</li>
        <li>Drop in the cut dough shapes and lower the heat to avoid the outside burning while the inside is uncooked. Flip the mandazi over every 30sec and cook for about 2min</li>
